CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Adhere STRICTLY to the existing UI layout and neobrutalist design system. You are ONLY authorized to ADD the UI elements I explicitly ask you to add. DO NOT rearrange, restyle, or remove any existing UI elements unless explicitly told to replace an old version. Any deviation from this will require a rollback.

Critical Checklist after providing code update:

Did you only ADD UI elements you were asked to add?
Is the existing layout otherwise unchanged?
Are all new elements styled using existing Tailwind classes and neobrutalist conventions established in the app design?
Are there any new, unexplained gaps or misalignments in the UI? If so, revert and simplify the addition.
